[95mAllogeneic Umbilical Cord Bloodâ€“Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell Implantation Versus Microfracture for Large, Full-Thickness Cartilage Defects in Older Patients: A Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial and Extended 5-Year Clinical Follow-up[0m

Background: There is currently no optimal method for cartilage restoration in large, full-thickness cartilage defects in older patients. Purpose: To determine whether implantation of a composite of allogeneic umbilical cord bloodâ€“derived mesenchymal stem cells and 4% hyaluronate (UCB-MSC-HA) will result in reliable cartilage restoration in patients with large, full-thickness cartilage defects and whether any clinical improvements can be maintained up to 5 years postoperatively. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A randomized controlled phase 3 clinical trial was conducted for 48 weeks, and the participants then underwent extended 5-year observational follow-up. Enrolled were patients with large, full-thickness cartilage defects (International Cartilage Repair Society [ICRS] grade 4) in a single compartment of the knee joint, as confirmed by arthroscopy. The defect was treated either with UCB-MSC-HA implantation through mini-arthrotomy or with microfracture. The primary outcome was proportion of participants who improved by â‰¥1 grade on the ICRS Macroscopic Cartilage Repair Assessment (blinded evaluation) at 48-week arthroscopy. Secondary outcomes included histologic assessment; changes in pain visual analog scale (VAS) score, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score from baseline; and adverse events. Results: Among 114 randomized participants (mean age, 55.9 years; 67% female; body mass index, 26.2 kg/m 2 ), 89 completed the phase 3 clinical trial and 73 were enrolled in the 5-year follow-up study. The mean defect size was 4.9 cm 2 in the UCB-MSC-HA group and 4.0 cm 2 in the microfracture group ( P = .051). At 48 weeks, improvement by â‰¥1 ICRS grade was seen in 97.7% of the UCB-MSC-HA group versus 71.7% of the microfracture group ( P = .001); the overall histologic assessment score was also superior in the UCB-MSC-HA group ( P = .036). Improvement in VAS pain, WOMAC, and IKDC scores were not significantly different between the groups at 48 weeks, however the clinical results were significantly better in the UCB-MSC-HA group at 3- to 5-year follow-up ( P &lt; .05). There were no differences between the groups in adverse events. Conclusion: In older patients with symptomatic, large, full-thickness cartilage defects with or without osteoarthritis, UCB-MSC-HA implantation resulted in improved cartilage grade at second-look arthroscopy and provided more improvement in pain and function up to 5 years compared with microfracture.

[95mUnicompartmental osteoarthritis: an integrated biomechanical and biological approach as alternative to metal resurfacing[0m

Although traditionally not indicated for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA), regenerative procedures are becoming a focus of increased interest due to their potential to provide pain relief and alter the progression of degenerative diseases. The purpose of this study was to assess whether a combined biomechanical and biological approach could offer good results in unicompartmental OA, thus delaying the need for unicompartmental arthroplasty in patients too young or refusing metal resurfacing. Forty-three patients (mean age = 40.1 +/- A 11 years, 33 men and 10 women, mean BMI = 25 +/- A 3) affected by unicompartmental OA (Kellegren-Lawrence score = 3) in stable joints were enrolled and treated consecutively. Fifteen patients were treated with osteotomy and osteochondral biomimetic scaffold implant (3 of them also with meniscal substitution), 11 with osteotomy and meniscal scaffold implant, 9 with osteotomy and meniscal allograft implant, and 8 with both cartilage and meniscal reconstruction, depending on the specific joint compartment main requirements. Clinical evaluation was performed at 3-year (2-4) median follow-up using the following scoring systems: IKDC subjective and objective, VAS for pain, and Tegner scores. Failures, adverse events, and complications were also reported. The IKDC subjective score improved from 47.3 to 79.6 at the final evaluation (p \textbackslashtextless 0.0005), VAS improved from 6.1 to 2.3 (p \textbackslashtextless 0.0005), and also sport activity level evaluated with the Tegner score showed a significant improvement, from 2 (1-5) to 4 (3-10; p \textbackslashtextless 0.0005), even if without achieving the pre-injury level (6, p = 0.001). A further subanalysis confirmed the positive outcome obtained in all the treatment subgroups and showed a higher clinical improvement in patients under the age of 40 years (IKDC subjective 84.4 +/- A 13.2 vs 76.5 +/- A 17.3; p = 0.03). This integrated biological and biomechanical approach produced a marked improvement at short-medium follow-up in patients affected by unicompartmental OA. Even though a good outcome was achieved at all ages, patients under the age of 40 years presented a greater clinical and subjective improvement. Longer follow-up studies are needed to show results over time and confirm this approach as an effective alternative to unicompartmental implants. Case series, Level IV.

[95mCartilage extra-cellular matrix biomembrane for the enhancement of microfractured defects[0m

The purpose of the study was to evaluate whether the biomembrane made of cartilage extracellular matrix, designed to provide cartilage-like favourable environments as well as to prevent against washout of blood clot after microfracture, would enhance cartilage repair compared with the conventional microfracture technique. A prospective trial was designed to compare the biomembrane cover after microfracture with conventional microfracture among patients with grade III-IV symptomatic cartilage defect in the knee joint. Patients aged 18-60 years were assigned to either the microfracture/biomembrane (n = 45) or microfracture groups (n = 19). Among them, 24 knees in the microfracture/biomembrane and 12 knees in the microfracture were followed up for 2 years. Cartilage repair was assessed with magnetic resonance imagings taken 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years postoperatively, and the clinical outcomes were also recorded. Compared with conventional microfracture, microfracture/biomembrane resulted in greater degree of cartilage repair (p = 0.043). In the intra-group analysis, while microfracture showed moderate to good degree of cartilage repair in nearly 50 % of the patients (47 % at 6 months to 50 % at 2 years; n.s.), microfracture/biomembrane maintained an equivalent degree of repair up to 2 years (88 % at 6 months to 75 % at 2 years; n.s.). The clinical outcome at 2 years also showed improved knee score and satisfaction and decreased pain in each group, but the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant. Compared with conventional microfracture, biomembrane cover after microfracture yielded superior outcome in terms of the degree of cartilage repair during 2 years of follow-up. This implies that initial protection of blood clot and immature repair tissue at the microfractured defect is important for the promotion of enhanced cartilage repair, which may be obtained by the application of a biomembrane. Prospective comparative study, Level II.

[95mMagnetic resonance imaging appearance of cartilage repair in the knee.[0m

Assessment of surgically repaired cartilage lesions with standardized cartilage sensitive magnetic resonance imaging was done to evaluate the integrity, morphologic features, and signal of the articular surface, thereby obtaining information about the natural history of these procedures in the knee. Magnetic resonance imaging also assessed the interface between the repaired and native cartilage, changes in the subchondral bone, and the appearance of cartilage over the opposite and adjacent (native) surfaces. One hundred eighty magnetic resonance imaging examinations were obtained in 112 patients who had cartilage-resurfacing procedures, including 86 microfractures and 35 autologous chondrocyte implantations, at a mean of 15 and 13 months after surgery, respectively. Autologous chondrocyte implantations showed consistently better fill of the defects at all times compared with microfracture. The graft hypertrophied in 63% of surgeries. The repair cartilage over the microfracture generally was depressed with respect to native cartilage. Propensity for bony overgrowth was most marked in the microfracture group, with loss of adjacent cartilage evident with progressive followup.

[95mBone Marrow Aspirate Concentrate versus Platelet Rich Plasma to Enhance Osseous Integration Potential for Osteochondral Allografts[0m

Abstract Fresh osteochondral allograft (OCA) transplantation is an attractive treatment option for symptomatic articular cartilage lesions in young, healthy patients. Since a lack of OCA bone integration can be a cause of treatment failure, methods for speeding and enhancing OCA bone integration to mitigate this potential complication are highly desirable. This study sought to determine and compare the potential of bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMC) and leukoreduced platelet rich plasma (PRP) to repopulate the osseous portion of an OCA with cells and deliver osteogenic proteins. It was hypothesized that BMC would have significantly higher colony forming units (CFUs)/mL and seed the osseous portion of OCA with more cells than PRP. Finally, we hypothesized that the media of BMC and PRP treated OCAs would have significantly higher concentrations of osteogenic proteins compared with negative control OCAs. Cylindrical OCAs (n = 36) created from tissue stored for 21 days were treated with BMC (n = 12) or PRP (n = 12) obtained for 6 dogs, or left untreated as a negative control (n = 12). After treatment, OCAs were cultured for 7 or 14 days. Media were collected for analysis of osteogenic biomarker concentration. Samples of each BMC and PRP were tested for CFU concentration. On day 7 or 14, the grafts were assessed for cell surface adhesion and penetration using fluorescent microscopy. Significant differences in CFU and media biomarker concentration between the groups were determined using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's post-hoc test with the significance set at p &lt; 0.05. Only OCAs saturated with BMC had viable cells detectable on the osseous portion of the allografts at day 7 and 14 of culture. BMC samples had a significantly higher (p = 0.029) CFU/mL compared with PRP samples. At day 3 and/or 7 of culture, the concentration of several osteogenic proteins was significantly higher in both BMC and PRP samples. Autogenous BMC can be used to deliver both a cell population and osteogenic proteins that may improve healing of the osseous portion of the OCA clinically.

[95mFocal cartilage defects in the knee â€“a randomized controlled trial comparing autologous chondrocyte implantation with arthroscopic debridement[0m

Focal cartilage injuries in the knee might have devastating effect due to the predisposition of early onset osteoarthritis. Various surgical treatment options are available, however no statistically significant differences have been found between the different surgical treatments. This supports the suggestion that the improvement might be a result of the post-operative rehabilitation rather than the surgery itself. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) has become a recognized treatment option for larger cartilage lesions in the knee. Although ACI has been compared to other surgical treatment such as microfracture and mosaicplasty, it has never been directly compared to simple arthroscopic debridement and rehabilitation alone. In this study we want to increase clinical and economic knowledge about autologous chondrocyte implantation compared to arthroscopic debridement and physical rehabilitation in the short and long run.We will conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare ACI with simple arthroscopic debridement (AD) and physiotherapy for the treatment of cartilage lesions in the knee. The study will include a total of 82 patients, both men and non-pregnant women, with a full thickness cartilage defect in the weight bearing area of the femoral condyles or trochlea larger than 2 cm2. The lesion must be symptomatic, with a Lysholm score less than 75. The two treatment groups will receive identical rehabilitation protocol according to a modification of Wondrasch et al., which is an active rehabilitation and education program divided into 3 phases: accommodation, rehabilitation and return to activity. The patients will be followed for 24 months, with additional late follow-ups at 5 and 10 years to monitor the potential onset of osteoarthtitis. The primary outcome measure will be the difference in the KOOS knee-related quality of life (QoL) subscore in the ACI group compared to the AD group at 2 years. A combination of self-explanatory questionnaires, clinical parameters, clinical hop tests and radiographs and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) will be used as secondary endpoints.This is the first study with a high level of evidence to compare ACI with simple debridement and physiotherapy for the treatment of isolated symptomatic full thickness lesions of the knee.ClinicalTrial NCT02636881 (21 December 2015).

[95mAutologous Chondrocyte Implantation Compared with Microfracture in the Knee[0m

New methods have been used, with promising results, to treat full-thickness cartilage defects. The objective of the present study was to compare autologous chondrocyte implantation with microfracture in a randomized trial. We are not aware of any previous randomized studies comparing these methods.Eighty patients without general osteoarthritis who had a single symptomatic cartilage defect on the femoral condyle in a stable knee were treated with autologous chondrocyte implantation or microfracture (forty in each group). We used the International Cartilage Repair Society, Lysholm, Short Form-36 (SF-36), and Tegner forms to collect data. An independent observer performed a follow-up examination at twelve and twenty-four months. Two years postoperatively, arthroscopy with biopsy for histological evaluation was carried out. The histological evaluation was done by a pathologist and a clinical scientist, both of whom were blinded to each patient's treatment.In general, there were small differences between the two treatment groups. At two years, both groups had significant clinical improvement. According to the SF-36 physical component score at two years postoperatively, the improvement in the microfracture group was significantly better than that in the autologous chondrocyte implantation group (p = 0.004). Younger and more active patients did better in both groups. There were two failures in the autologous chondrocyte implantation group and one in the microfracture group. No serious complications were reported. Biopsy specimens were obtained from 84% of the patients, and histological evaluation of repair tissues showed no significant differences between the two groups. We did not find any association between the histological quality of the tissue and the clinical outcome according to the scores on the Lysholm or SF-36 form or the visual analog scale.Both methods had acceptable short-term clinical results. There was no significant difference in macroscopic or histological results between the two treatment groups and no association between the histological findings and the clinical outcome at the two-year time-point.Therapeutic study, Level I-1a (randomized controlled trial [significant difference]).

[95mAllogenic umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stromal cell implantation was superior to bone marrow aspirate concentrate augmentation for cartilage regeneration despite similar clinical outcomes[0m

Purpose The aim of this study was to compare clinical and second-look arthroscopic outcomes between bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) augmentation and human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stromal cell (hUCB-MSC) implantation in high tibial osteotomy (HTO) for medial compartmental knee osteoarthritis and identify the relationship between articular cartilage regeneration and HTO outcomes. Methods A total of 176 patients who underwent HTO combined with a BMAC or hUCB-MSC procedure for medial compartment osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 3) between June 2014 and September 2018 with a minimum follow-up of 2 years were reviewed. After HTO, multiple holes were drilled at cartilage defect sites of the medial femoral condyle (MFC), and then prepared BMAC or hUCB-MSCs in combination with scaffolds were implanted in the MFC lesions. After propensity score matching based on sex, age, body mass index, and lesion size, 55 patients in each of the BMAC and hUCB-MSC groups were successfully matched. Second-look arthroscopic findings were assessed according to the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) Cartilage Repair Assessment (CRA) grading system and Koshino staging system. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Short-Form 36 (SF-36), and Tegner activity scores. Results At a mean follow-up of 33 months, clinical outcomes including IKDC, KOOS, SF-36, and Tegner activity scores were significantly improved in both groups (p \textbackslashtextless 0.001); however, there were no differences between the two groups. Second-look arthroscopy showed better healing of regenerated cartilage in the hUCB-MSC group (Grade I [4 cases, 9.1%]; Grade II [30 cases, 68.2%]; Grade III [11 cases, 22.7%]) than in the BMAC group (Grade I [1 case, 2.7%]; Grade II [20 cases, 54.1%]; Grade III [11 cases, 29.7%]; Grade IV [5 cases, 13.5%]) according to the ICRS CRA grading system (p = 0.040). There was no significant intergroup difference in terms of defect coverage based on the Koshino staging system (p = 0.057). Moreover, ICRS CRA grades at second-look arthroscopy were significantly correlated with clinical outcomes (r = - 0.337; p = 0.002). Conclusion There were no significant differences in the clinical outcomes between the two groups. Both treatments provided similar, reliable outcomes in terms of pain relief, functional scores, and quality of life at a mean follow-up of 33 months. However, hUCB-MSC implantation was more effective than BMAC augmentation for articular cartilage regeneration.

[95mNovel Scaffold-Based BST-CarGel Treatment Results in Superior Cartilage Repair Compared with Microfracture in a Randomized Controlled Trial[0m

Microfracture, the standard of care, is recognized to be an incomplete solution for cartilage damage. BST-CarGel, a chitosan-based medical device, is mixed with autologous whole blood and is applied to a microfractured cartilage lesion in which it physically stabilizes the clot and guides and enhances marrow-derived repair. An international, multicenter, randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate BST-CarGel treatment compared with microfracture alone in the repair of cartilage lesions in the knee.Eighty patients between the ages of eighteen and fifty-five years with a single, symptomatic focal lesion on the femoral condyles were randomized to BST-CarGel and microfracture treatment (n = 41) or microfracture treatment alone (n = 39). The primary end points of repair tissue quantity and quality at twelve months were assessed by quantitative three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging measuring the degree of lesion filling and T2 relaxation time with use of standardized one and twelve-month posttreatment scans. The secondary end point at twelve months was clinical benefit determined with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. The tertiary end point was quality of life determined by the Short Form-36. Safety was assessed through the recording of adverse events.Patient baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups, although baseline lesion areas were slightly larger on quantitative magnetic resonance imaging for the BST-CarGel group compared with the microfracture group. Blinded quantitative magnetic resonance imaging analysis demonstrated that, at twelve months, when compared with microfracture treatment alone, BST-CarGel treatment met both primary end points by achieving statistical superiority for greater lesion filling (p = 0.011) and more hyaline cartilage-like T2 values (p = 0.033). The lesion filling values were 92.8% Â± 2.0% for the BST-CarGel treatment group and 85.2% Â± 2.1% for the microfracture treatment group, and the mean T2 values were 70.5 Â± 4.5 ms for the BST-CarGel treatment group and 85.0 Â± 4.9 ms for the microfracture treatment group. Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index subscales for pain, stiffness, and function yielded equivalent improvement for both groups at twelve months, which were significant (p < 0.0001) from baseline. Treatment safety profiles were considered comparable.At twelve months, BST-CarGel treatment resulted in greater lesion filling and superior repair tissue quality compared with microfracture treatment alone. Clinical benefit was equivalent between groups at twelve months, and safety was similar.

[95mSevere Bone Marrow Edema Among Patients Who Underwent Prior Marrow Stimulation Technique Is a Significant Predictor of Graft Failure After Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation[0m

Background: Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) is a well-established cartilage repair procedure; however, numerous studies have shown higher ACI graft failure rates after prior marrow stimulation techniques (MSTs). Purpose: To identify which factors may predict decreased graft survival after ACI among patients who underwent a prior MST. A secondary aim was to investigate the specificity of these predictors. Study Design: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: In this review of prospectively collected data, the authors analyzed 38 patients who had failed prior MST surgery and subsequently underwent collagen-covered ACI (case group). The case group was divided into graft failure ACI (n = 8, 21%) and successful ACI (n = 30, 79%). Fourteen clinical variables were categorized and analyzed to determine predictors for failure of the ACI graft: age, body mass index, sex, defect characteristics (number, size, location, etiology, type), presence of kissing lesion, intraoperative presence of intralesional osteophyte, time between an MST and ACI, previous surgery, duration of the symptoms, and concomitant surgical procedure. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to evaluate the severity of subchondral bone marrow edema (BME), graded I (absent) to IV (severe), and the presence of subchondral cyst, hypertrophic sclerosis, and intralesional osteophyte. The effects of these MRI findings on the graft survivor were also investigated. Concurrently, a control group without a prior MST was matched to investigate the specificity of the previously determined predictors. These patients were matched individually according to age, sex, body mass index, and outcome of the procedure (failure [n = 8] or successful [n = 30] per the case group). Results: In the case group, the presence of preoperative severe BME was significantly higher among patients with failed ACI as compared with patients with successful ACI ( P &lt; .001). In the control group, the presence of severe BME was not significantly different between the failure and successful groups ( P = .747). The ACI graft failure rate among patients with a prior MST and preoperative grade IV BME was 83.7% at 5 years postoperatively, resulting in a significantly lower survival rate as compared with patients with a prior MST and without severe BME (5-year graft failure rate, 6.5%; P &lt; .001). All the other parameters did not differ significantly. Conclusion: After a prior MST, the presence of grade IV BME by MRI was a predictive factor for graft failure among patients who then underwent second-generation ACI.

[95mIdentification of Candidate Synovial Fluid Biomarkers for the Prediction of Patient Outcome After Microfracture or Osteotomy[0m

Biomarkers are needed to predict clinical outcomes for microfracture and osteotomy surgeries to ensure patients can be better stratified to receive the most appropriate treatment.To identify novel biomarker candidates and to investigate the potential of a panel of protein biomarkers for the prediction of clinical outcome after treatment with microfracture or osteotomy.Descriptive laboratory study.To identify novel candidate biomarker proteins, we used label-free quantitation after liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry of dynamic range-compressed synovial fluids (SFs) from individuals who responded excellently or poorly (based on change in Lysholm score) to microfracture (n = 6) or osteotomy (n = 7). Biomarkers that were identified in this proteomic analysis or that relate to osteoarthritis (OA) severity or have predictive value in another early OA therapy (autologous cell implantation) were measured in the SF of 19 and 13 patients before microfracture or osteotomy, respectively, using commercial immunoassays, and were normalized to urea. These were aggrecanase-1 (ADAMTS-4), cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), hyaluronan (HA), lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE-1), matrix metalloproteinase 1 and 3, soluble CD14, S100 calcium binding protein A13, and 14-3-3 protein theta (YWHAQ). Levels of COMP and HA were also measured in the plasma of these patients. To find predictors of postoperative function, multivariable regression analyses were performed.Proteomic analyses highlighted YWHAQ and LYVE-1 as being differentially abundant between the clinical responders/improvers and nonresponders after microfracture. A linear regression model after backward variable selection could relate preoperative concentrations of SF proteins (HA, YWHAQ, LYVE-1), activity of ADAMTS-4, and patient demographic characteristics (smoker status and sex) with Lysholm score 12 months after microfracture. Further, a generalized linear model with elastic net penalization indicated that lower preoperative activity of ADAMTS-4 in SF, being a nonsmoker, and being younger at the time of operation were indicative of a higher postoperative Lysholm score (improved joint function) after osteotomy surgery.We have identified biomarkers and generated regression models with the potential to predict clinical outcome in patients treated with microfracture or osteotomy of the knee.Candidate protein biomarkers identified in this study have the potential to help determine which patients will be best suited to treatment with microfracture or osteotomy.

[95mEvaluation of an Autologous Bone Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Extracellular Matrix Scaffold in a Rabbit and Minipig Model of Cartilage Repair[0m

BACKGROUND:This study aimed to evaluate an autologous bone mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffold in two animal models of cartilage repair. MATERIAL AND METHODS:A rabbit model (n=16) and a minipig model (n=8) of cartilage repair were created with cartilage defects of the knee joints treated with bone marrow stimulation (BMS). In the ECM group, autologous bone MSC-derived ECM scaffolds were implanted into the cartilage defects after bone marrow stimulation. In the BMS group, the cartilage defects were treated by bone marrow stimulation only. The renewal capacity of bone MSCs was measured with a colony-forming unit fibroblast (CFU-F) in vitro assay. The extent of cartilage repair was as-sessed at 6 months after surgery. RESULTS:In the rabbit model, the macroscopic appearance of the exudate of the healing wounds in the ECM group showed less fibrosis, and the histology showed more evenly distributed chondrocytes compared with the BMS group. The CFU-F assay showed that the number of bone MSCs in the ECM group was approximately was twice that of the BMS group. In the minipig model, the macroscopic appearance and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of the ECM group were improved when compared with the BMS group. The repaired tissue in ECM group had similar histological characteristics and biochemical content to normal hyaline cartilage. CONCLUSIONS:In two animal models of knee joint cartilage repair, the use of an ECM scaffold increased the number of bone MSCs and improved the extent of cartilage repair.

[95mEffects of tranexamic acid on the recovery of osteochondral defects treated by microfracture and acellular matrix scaffold: an experimental study[0m

Microfracture and scaffold application in the treatment of osteochondral defects is still one of the most frequently used methods in the clinic. The most important step in this treatment method is the stabilization of fibrin clot. Tranexamic acid (TA) is an antifibrinolytic agent commonly used in orthopedic surgery in recent years. This study evaluated the effect of local TA application on healing of experimentally induced osteochondral defects on rabbits.This paper contains an animal in vivo data and histological outcomes on the effect of TA. Eighteen New Zealand white rabbits were treated unilaterally and cylindrical defects having a width of 4 mm and depth of 5 mm were created in the weight-bearing surfaces of the medial and lateral condyles of the right femur. They were divided into two groups, as group 1 study and group 2 control groups, respectively. One milliliter (ml) of TA was injected into the knee joints of the subjects in group 1. All animals were sacrificed for the extraction of the femur condyles for histologic study at the fourth and eighth weeks after surgery. Histological evaluations were performed by Brittberg and O'Driscoll scores to all samples. Data were organized in a Standard Statistical Package System v.22 software package (SPSS/PC Inc., Chicago, IL.) and reported as mean and median (min-max). Repeated measures ANOVA test was used to compare groups and condyle effects together for each week. p values below 0.05 were considered as statistically significant.Samples were taken in the fourth and eighth weeks. The regularity of the surface in group 1 was smoother, and the tissue stability was more robust. Mean Brittberg scores in both weeks were statistically higher in group 1 when compared with group 2. In the microscopic evaluation, it was observed that the regeneration of subchondral and cartilage tissues were more rapid and organized in group 1, and the mean O' Driscoll scores in both weeks were statistically higher in group 1.Application of TA improves the healing time and tissue stability in osteochondral defects which are implanted a-cellular scaffold after microfracture and should be applicable to humans for the treatment of osteochondral defects.

[95mRepair of articular cartilage defects by tissue-engineered cartilage constructed with adipose-derived stem cells and acellular cartilaginous matrix in rabbits[0m

After injury, inflammation, or degeneration, articular cartilage has limited self-repair ability. We aimed to explore the feasibility of repair of articular cartilage defects with tissue-engineered cartilage constructed by acellular cartilage matrices (ACMs) seeded with adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs). The ADSCs were isolated from 3-month-old New Zealand albino rabbit by using collagenase and cultured and amplified in vitro. Fresh cartilage isolated from adult New Zealand albino rabbit were freeze-dried for 12 h and treated with Triton X-100, DNase, and RNase to obtain ACMs. ADSCs were seeded in the acellular cartilaginous matrix at 2x10(7)/mL, and cultured in chondrogenic differentiation medium for 2 weeks to construct tissue-engineered cartilage. Twenty-four New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into A, B, and C groups. Engineered cartilage was transplanted into cartilage defect position of rabbits in group A, group B obtained ACMs, and group C did not receive any transplants. The rabbits were sacrificed in week 12. The restored tissue was evaluated using macroscopy, histology, immunohistochemistry, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In the tissue-engineered cartilage group (group A), articular cartilage defects of the rabbits were filled with chondrocyte-like tissue with smooth surface. Immunohistochemistry showed type II-collagen expression and Alcian blue staining was positive. TEM showed chondrocytes in the recesses, with plenty of secretary matrix particles. In the scaffold group (group B), the defect was filled with fibrous tissue. No repaired tissue was found in the blank group (group C). Tissue-engineered cartilage using ACM seeded with ADSCs can help repair articular cartilage defects in rabbits.

[95mTibial Plateau Cartilage Lesions: A Systematic Review of Techniques, Outcomes, and Complications[0m

The purpose of this systematic review is to determine (1) current reported treatment options for isolated tibial plateau (TP) cartilage lesions, (2) patient reported outcomes following various treatments, and (3) complication rate and survivorship following various treatments.A literature search of PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and CINAHL was conducted adhering to PRISMA guidelines. Patients were included if they had TP cartilage lesions treated with surgery. Lesion characteristics, surgical procedure details, patient reported outcomes, complication, and failure rates were collected.Thirteen studies yielded 205 knees with TP cartilage lesions treated surgically. Ages ranged from 12 to 77 years. Surgical techniques included 138 treated with osteochondral allograft transplantation (OCA), 37 treated with osteochondral autograft transfer system (OATS), 11 treated with microfracture, 11 treated with an osteochondral scaffold, and 8 treated with autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI). The patient-reported outcome measures were heterogeneous, but all reported improvements with the notable exception of one study evaluating microfracture. The rate of complications ranged from 0% to 4.6%. Failure rate ranged from 22% to 46% for OCA and 0% to 16% for OATS. No failures were reported for the additional techniques.Various surgical techniques have been utilized for the treatment of TP cartilage lesions. Patient-reported outcome measures were heterogeneous, but improvements were reported following all surgical treatments except for microfracture, which resulted in decreased scores at mid-term follow-up. The complication rate was low for all techniques described. However, the failure rate was higher following unicondylar OCA for salvage treatment of posttraumatic deformities.

[95mMatrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation for a large chondral defect in a professional football player: a case report[0m

IntroductionMatrix-assisted autologous chondrocyte implantation is a well-known procedure for the treatment of cartilage defects, which aims to establish a regenerative milieu and restore hyaline cartilage. However, much less is known about third-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation application in high-level athletes. We report on the two-year follow-up outcome after matrix-assisted autologous chondrocyte implantation to treat a large cartilage lesion of the lateral femoral condyle in a male Caucasian professional football player.Case presentationA 27-year-old male Caucasian professional football player was previously treated for cartilage problems of his left knee with two failed microfracture procedures resulting in a 9 cm2 Outerbridge Grade 4 chondral lesion at his lateral femoral condyle. Preoperative Tegner-Lysholm and Brittberg-Peterson scores were 64 and 58, and by the second year they were 91 and 6. An evaluation with magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated filling of the defect with the signal intensity of the repair tissue resembling healthy cartilage. Second-look arthroscopy revealed robust, smooth cartilage covering his lateral femoral condyle. He returned to his former competitive level without restrictions or complaints one year after the procedure.ConclusionsThis case illustrates that robust cartilage tissue can be obtained with a matrix-assisted autologous chondrocyte implantation procedure even after two failed microfracture procedures in a large (9 cm2) cartilage defect. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report on the application of the third-generation cell therapy treatment technique, matrix-assisted autologous chondrocyte implantation, in a professional football player.

[95mCartilage damage caused by metal implants applied for the treatment of established localized cartilage defects in a rabbit model[0m

The purpose of the current study was to investigate the feasibility of the application of defect-size femoral implants in a rabbit model of established cartilage defects and compare this treatment to microfracturing. In 31 New Zealand White rabbits, a medial femoral condyle defect was created in each knee. After 4 weeks, 3 animals were killed for defect baseline values. In the other 28 rabbits, knees were sham-operated, treated with microfracturing, or treated by placing an oxidized zirconium (OxZr) or cobalt-chromium (CoCr) implant (theta articulating surface 3.5 mm; fixating pin of 9.1 mm length). These animals were sacrificed 4 weeks after treatment. Joints were evaluated macroscopically. Implant osseointegration was measured by automated histomorphometry, and cartilage repair was scored microscopically. Cartilage quality was analyzed macroscopically and microscopically. Bone-implant contact was 63.2% +/- 3.2% for CoCr and 62.5% +/- 3.2% for OxZr. Cartilage defects did not show complete healing, nor during subsequent sham-surgery or microfracturing. For all treatments, considerable cartilage damage in the articulating medial tibia, and degeneration of lateral tibial and femoral cartilage was observed (p < 0.05). Both CoCr and OxZr implant-treated defects showed an increase of cartilage degeneration compared to microfracturing and sham-operated defects (p < 0.05). Although only a single short-term follow-up period was investigated in this study, caution is warranted using small metal implants as a treatment for established localized cartilage defects because, even after 4 weeks in this model, the metal implants caused considerable degeneration of the articulating surface.

[95mPractice in rehabilitation after cartilage therapy: an expert survey[0m

BACKGROUND: Current cartilage therapy modalities like microfracture, ACT/MACT, AMIC or osteochondral transplantation are important tools to treat symptomatic (osteo)chondral lesions of the knee joint. However, until now there exists no high-level evidence based accepted rehabilitation plan for the postoperative treatment. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: This survey describes the predominantly used rehabilitation plan as implemented by expert musculoskeletal surgeons for operatively treated (osteo)chondral lesions. STUDY DESIGN: Survey and systematic review. METHODS: An electronic questionnaire covering general and specific items concerning aftercare following cartilage therapy in the knee joint was designed and disposed to analyze rehabilitation programs among a population of expert musculoskeletal surgeons of the AGA (Society of arthroscopy and joint surgery). All instructors (304 in 01/2011) were included into the survey. A total of 246 (80.9 %) instructors answered the questionnaire. RESULTS: The predominant used therapy to treat cartilage lesions is microfracture and for osteochondral lesions the osteochondral transplantation. Physiotherapy starts directly after surgery and takes more than 6 weeks. Most surgeons do not immobilize patients after surgery and use partial weight-bearing for up to 5 weeks. The change from partial to full weight-bearing is done step-wise with a 20-kg/week increase. Free ROM is allowed by the majority of instructors (55 %) directly after surgery. A CPM-device is also used directly and up to 5 weeks. Swimming and biking are allowed after 6 weeks, running is allowed after 12 weeks and contact sports after 24 weeks. Most instructors do not use braces in the aftercare procedure, but nearly all (93 %) prescribe crutches. Typical drugs used during the aftercare are NSAID, Heparin and antibiotics. For most instructors (79 % respectively 75 %) knee stability and a straight leg axis are necessary for a successful cartilage therapy. If a concomitant therapy like ACL reconstruction or an osteotomy is performed, aftercare is mainly dependent on cartilage therapy (62 % respectively 59 % of instructors). CONCLUSIONS: Today there exists no detailed rehabilitation program for treatment after a cartilage-related operation on the basis of an evidence-based level I study. The reason might be that many variables contribute to a specific aftercare procedure. Therefore, the survey of experienced surgeons may help to identify the most promising rehabilitation regime for today, at least until evidence-based level I studies are accomplished.

[95mIn-situ engineering of cartilage repair: a pre-clinical in-vivo exploration of a novel system[0m

This investigation explores a new cartilage repair technique that uses a novel method to secure a non-woven multifilamentous scaffold in the defect site after microfracture. The hypothesis is that a scaffold provides a larger surface area for attachment and proliferation of the mesenchymal stem cells that migrate from the bone marrow. Two in-vivo studies were undertaken in an ovine model. The first study, which lasted for 8 weeks, aimed to compare the new technique with microfracture. Chondral defects, 7 mm in diameter, were created in both femoral medial condyles of five ewes. One defect was treated with the new technique while the contralateral knee was treated with microfracture alone. The results revealed that the quantity of repair tissue was significantly greater in the defects treated with the new system. The second study had two time points, 3 and 6 months, and used 13 ewes. In this study, both defects were treated with the new technique but one received additional subchondral drilling in order to stimulate extra tissue growth. The majority of the implants had good tissue induction, filling 50-100 per cent of the defect volume, while the compressive modulus of the repairs was in the range of 40-70 per cent of that for the surrounding cartilage. In addition, hyaline-like cartilage was seen in all the repairs which had the additional drilling of the subchondral bone.

[95mPre-culture of human mesenchymal stromal cells in spheroids facilitates chondrogenesis at a low total cell count upon embedding in biomaterials to generate cartilage microtissues[0m

Material-assisted cartilage tissue engineering has limited application in cartilage treatment due to hypertrophic tissue formation and high cell counts required. This study aimed at investigating the potential of human mesenchymal stromal cell (hMSC) spheroids embedded in biomaterials to study the effect of biomaterial composition on cell differentiation. Pre-cultured (3 days, chondrogenic differentiation media) spheroids (250 cells/spheroid) were embedded in tyramine-modified hyaluronic acid (THA) and collagen type I (Col) composite hydrogels (four combinations of THA (12.5 vs 16.7 mg/ml) and Col (2.5 vs 1.7 mg/ml) content) at a cell density of 5 Ã— 106 cells/ml (2 Ã— 104 spheroids/ml). Macropellets derived from single hMSCs (2.5 Ã— 105 cells, ScMP) or hMSC spheroids (2.5 Ã— 105 cells, 103 spheroids, SpMP) served as control. hMSC differentiation was analyzed using glycosaminoglycan (GAG) quantification, gene expression analysis and (immuno-)histology. Embedding of hMSC spheroids in THA-Col induced chondrogenic differentiation marked by upregulation of aggrecan (ACAN) and COL2A1, and the production of GAGs . Lower THA led to more pronounced chondrogenic phenotype compared to higher THA content. Col content had no significant influence on hMSC chondrogenesis. Pellet cultures showed an upregulation in chondrogenic-associated genes and production of GAGs with less upregulation of hypertrophic-associated genes in SpMP culture compared to ScMP group. This study presents hMSC pre-culture in spheroids as promising approach to study chondrogenic differentiation after biomaterial encapsulation at low total cell count (5 Ã— 106/ml) without compromising chondrogenic matrix production. This approach can be applied to assemble microtissues in biomaterials to generate large cartilage construct. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: In vitro studies investigating the chondrogenic potential of biomaterials are limited due to the low cell-cell contact of encapsulated single cells. Here, we introduce the use of pre-cultured hMSC spheroids to study chondrogenesis upon encapsulation in a biomaterial. The use of spheroids takes advantage of the high cell-cell contact within each spheroid being critical in the early chondrogenesis of hMSCs. At a low seeding density of 5Â·106 cells/ml (2 Ã— 104 spheroids/ml) we demonstrated hMSC chondrogenesis and cartilaginous matrix deposition. Our results indicate that the pre-culture might have a beneficial effect on hypertrophic gene expression without compromising chondrogenic differentiation. This approach has shown potential to assemble microtissues (here spheroids) in biomaterials to generate large cartilage constructs and to study the effect of biomaterial composition on cell alignment and migration.
